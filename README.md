Just walked out of the theater after seeing Demon City and honestly, my brain feels like it’s had a blender party with way too much caffeine. I mean, was that visual chaos on purpose? I swear I felt reassured and confused at the same time, which is a neat trick if you ask me.

Let's not mince words: Demon City doesn't hold your hand—more like it shoves you down a rabbit hole and then skips away cackling. The whole scheme is more colorful than a raccoon at a glitter rave. Oh, the sound! A symphony of anxiety and unease paired with visuals that seemed to be crafted by someone who thought kaleidoscopes were too tame. Does my heart ever go boom? I think it just did, fireworks and all.

The characters... I can’t decide if the actors were having the time of their lives or if they were just as lost as I was. There's this guy with a trench coat, classic, lurking around trying to be all enigmatic, yet sometimes he appears badly needing a hug. The villain could’ve come straight out of a fever dream. His laugh echoed, and I swear it's gonna haunt my shower time. Good times.

> At one point, I couldn't help but think: is this how our brains feel when trying to understand physics after a sleepless night? And the dialogue, oh dear. Quite philosophical, in an “I’m not following but it sounds deep” sorta way.

The climax? Explosive. Think of the Fourth of July aggressively crashing a quiet book club meeting. Yet here I am, tangled in a web of thoughts and just a hint of regret that I didn’t grab another popcorn. I mean, Demon City is a   that kinda slaps you across the face and instead of feeling offended, you’re like, Yeah alright, I’ll 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 this later.

All said and done, I might advise others to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . It’s like bungee jumping into a pond of gelatin—unexpectedly intense and oddly satisfying. But maybe save it for a day when you’re craving metaphoric mayhem, or if you just wanna reassure yourself that reality is just a tad saner.
